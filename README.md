# about-me-page


In March 2015 I discovered [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com), and this was my very first about-me-page [project](https://www.codecademy.com/yunav/codebits/o44zBJ) for its HTML & CSS web [course](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/htmlcss).   


In February 2016 I wrote a blog post titled ["My Year In Coding"] (https://medium.com/@AyunasCode/my-year-in-coding-aef6b7378816#.wphy4qnho) about the things I did in 2015 and about my progress learning to code.  


I love coding because there's always room for learning and growth. I'm passionate about teamwork, product development and problem solving. 


I'm looking for an iOS developer position at a company, where I can learn, grow, and build great products together with a diverse team of passionate driven people. Know one? Please send me a message via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayunavogel) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AyunasCode). Thanks!
