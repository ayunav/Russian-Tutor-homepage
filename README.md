# about-me-page


In March 2015 I discovered CodeCademy, and this was my very first about-me-page project for its HTML & CSS web course.   


In February 2016 I wrote a blog post titled ["My Year In Coding"] (https://medium.com/@AyunasCode/my-year-in-coding-aef6b7378816#.wphy4qnho) about the things I did in 2015 and about my progress learning to code.
